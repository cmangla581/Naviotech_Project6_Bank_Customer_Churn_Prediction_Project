# Naviotech_Project6_Bank_Customer_Churn_Prediction_Project

This is the famous Bank Customer Churn Prediction Project which is based on predicting whether a customer will remain or churn in a bank using the Random Forest Classification Algorithm. 

The Random Forest Classification Algorithm is a very useful algorith as it gives high accuracy and also makes the predictions based on the Decision Trees. This model basically tells a bank that 
which customers are likely to remain in the bank and which customers are likely to churn or leave from the bank. 1 represents a customer who left the bank whereas 0 represents the customer who remain in the bank.  

Here, the predictions of the customer churn has been made on mainly 9 parameters which are as: 

  Total Charges
  
  Monthly Charges 
  
  Tenure  
  
  Contract Type  
  
  Internet Service 
  
  Payment Method 
  
  Tech Support 
  
  Online Security 
  
  Paperless Billing 

# Model Accuracy : 77.19 %  

Here, for further visualization, the several plots have been made which are as: 

       Correlation Heatmap 
       Confusion Matrix 
       Histograms 
       Boxplots   

The Python libraries used include: 

             Streamlit 
             Numpy 
             Pandas 
             Matplotlib 
             Seaborn 
             Scikit-Learn 
             
Here, along with the analysis on the Jupyter Notebook, I've also made the Streamlit UI App to make it more accessible for the users.
